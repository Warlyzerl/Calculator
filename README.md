# Calculator
Building a simple calculator with Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide functions.


After finishing this project...

I am quite happy with how this turned out and I learned a lot about CSS grid although I did not include it in this project. 

I've also learned the importance of mapping out every possibility that the program can be used.
As I was messing around with my calculator and clicking random buttoms, I noticed many small oversights that caused bugs. 

I realized that going back and having to re-think the logic I had written before is probably much harder than doing it right the first time. For my next project, I will make an UML and try to brainstorm possible bugs that may occur to avoid the painful process of re-writing old logic.
